# Pomodoro App

  This is a simple Pomodoro app which is based on the Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks usually about 5 minutes.

  - In this app by default the timer will start from 25 minutes.
  
  - We can pause and resume the timer.
  
  - The timer can be reset entirely.
  
  - We can manually select the work time between 5 minutes - 60 minutes (where the incrementation of the time will be done by 5 minutes), instead using the traditional 25 minutes.
  
  - We can also manually select the break time between 5 minutes - 60 minutes (where the incrementation of the time will be done by 5 minutes), instead using the traditional 5 minutes.
